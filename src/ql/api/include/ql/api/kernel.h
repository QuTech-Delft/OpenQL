/**
 * Represents a kernel of a quantum program, a.k.a. a basic block. Kernels are
 * just sequences of gates with no classical control-flow in between: they may
 * end in a (conditional) branch to the start of another kernel, but otherwise,
 * they may only consist of quantum gates and mixed quantum-classical data flow
 * operations.
 *
 * Currently, kernels can be constructed only by adding gates and classical data
 * flow instructions in the order in which they are to be executed, and there is
 * no way to get information about which gates are in the kernel after the fact.
 * If you need this kind of bookkeeping, you will have to wrap OpenQL's kernels
 * for now.
 *
 * Classical flow-control is configured when a completed kernel is added to a
 * program, via basic structured control-flow paradigms (if-else, do-while, and
 * loops with a fixed iteration count).
 *
 * NOTE: the way gates are represented in OpenQL is on the list to be completely
 * revised. Currently OpenQL works using a mixture of "default gates" and the
 * "custom gates" that you can specify in the platform configuration file, but
 * these two things are not orthogonal and largely incompatible with each other,
 * yet are currently used interchangeably. Furthermore, there is no proper way
 * to specify lists of generic arguments to a gate, leading to lots of code
 * duplication inside OpenQL and long gate() argument lists. Finally, the
 * semantics of gates are largely derived by undocumented and somewhat heuristic
 * string comparisons with the names of gates, which is terrible design in
 * combination with user-specified instruction sets via the platform
 * configuration file. The interface for adding simple *quantum* gates to a
 * kernel is something we want to keep 100% backward compatible, but the more
 * advanced gate() signatures may change in the (near) future.
 *
 * NOTE: classical logic is on the list to be completely revised. This interface
 * may change in the (near) future.
 *
 * NOTE: the higher-order functions for constructing controlled kernels and
 * conjugating kernels have not been maintained for a while and thus probably
 * won't work right. They may be removed entirely in a later version of OpenQL.
