 * Initial placement engine.
 *
 * InitialPlace: initial placement solved as an MIP (mixed integer linear
 * program). The initial placement is modelled as a Quadratic Assignment Problem
 * by Lingling Lao in her mapping paper:
 *
 * variables:
 *     forall i: forall k: x[i][k], x[i][k] is integral and 0 or 1, meaning qubit i is in location k
 * objective:
 *     min z = sum i: sum j: sum k: sum l: refcount[i][j] * distance(k,l) * x[i][k] * x[j][l]
 * subject to:
 *     forall k: ( sum i: x[i][k] <= 1 )        allow more locations than qubits
 *     forall i: ( sum k: x[i][k] == 1 )        but each qubit must have one locations
 *
 * the article "An algorithm for the quadratic assignment problem using Benders' decomposition"
 * by L. Kaufman and F. Broeckx, transforms this problem by introducing w[i][k] as follows:
 *
 * forall i: forall k: w[i][k] =  x[i][k] * ( sum j: sum l: refcount[i][j] * distance(k,l) * x[j][l] )
 *
 * to the following mixed integer linear problem:
 *
 *  precompute:
 *      forall i: forall k: costmax[i][k] = sum j: sum l: refcount[i][j] * distance(k,l)
 *      (note: each of these costmax[][] is >= 0, so the "max(this,0)" around this is not needed)
 *  variables:
 *      forall i: forall k: x[i][k], x[i][k] is integral and 0 or 1
 *      forall i: forall k: w[i][k], w[i][k] is real and >= 0
 *  objective:
 *      min z = sum i: sum k: w[i][k]
 *  subject to:
 *      forall k: ( sum i: x[i][k] <= 1 )
 *      forall i: ( sum k: x[i][k] == 1 )
 *      forall i: forall k: costmax[i][k] * x[i][k]
 *          + ( sum j: sum l: refcount[i][j]*distance(k,l)*x[j][l] ) - w[i][k] <= costmax[i][k]
 *
 * This model is coded in lemon/mip below.
 * The latter is mapped onto glpk.
 *
 * Since solving takes a while, two ways are offered to deal with this (and
 * these can be combined):
 *
 *  - the initial placement "horizon" may be used to limit the number of
 *    two-qubit gates considered by the solver to the first N for each kernel;
 *  - a timeout may be specified.
