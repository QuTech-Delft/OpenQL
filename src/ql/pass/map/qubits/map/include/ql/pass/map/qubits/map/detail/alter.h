/**
 * Alter: one alternative way to make two real qbits (operands of a 2-qubit
 * gate) nearest neighbor (NN).
 *
 * Of these two qubits, the first qubit is called the source, the second is
 * called the target qubit. The Alter stores a series of real qubit indices;
 * qubits/indices are equivalent to the nodes in the grid. An Alter represents
 * a 2-qubit gate and a path through the grid from source to target qubit, with
 * each hop between qubits/nodes only between neighboring nodes in the grid. The
 * intention is that all but one of the hops translate into swaps, and that the
 * one hop that remains will be the place to do the 2-qubit gate.
 *
 * Actually, the Alter goes through several stages.
 *
 *  - First, for the given 2-qubit gate that is stored in targetgp, while
 *    finding a path from its source to its target, the current path is kept in
 *    total. from_source, from_target, past and score are not used; past is a
 *    clone of the main past.
 *  - Paths are found starting from the source node, and aiming to reach the
 *    target node, each time adding one additional hop to the path. from_source,
 *    from_target, and score are still empty and not used.
 *  - Each time another continuation of the path is found, the current Alter is
 *    cloned and the difference continuation represented in the total attribute;
 *    it all starts with an empty Alter. from_source, from_target, and score are
 *    still empty and not used.
 *  - Once all alternative total paths for the 2-qubit gate from source to
 *    target have been found, each of these is split again in all possible ways
 *    (to ILP overlap swaps from source and target); the split is the place
 *    where the two-qubit gate is put.
 *  - The alternative splits are made separate Alters and for each of these the
 *    two partial paths are stored in fromSource and fromTarget. A partial path
 *    stores its starting and end nodes (so contains 1 hop less than its
 *    length). The partial path of the target operand is reversed, so it starts
 *    at the target qubit.
 *  - We add swaps to past following the recipe in fromSource and fromTarget.
 *    This extends past. Also, we compute score as the latency extension caused
 *    by these swaps.
 *
 * At the end, we have a list of Alters, each with a private Past, and a private
 * latency extension. The partial paths represent lists of swaps to be inserted.
 * The initial two-qubit gate gets the qubits at the ends of the partial paths
 * as operands. The main selection criterium from the Alters is to select the
 * one with the minimum latency extension. Having done that, the other Alters
 * can be discarded, and the selected one committed to the main Past.
