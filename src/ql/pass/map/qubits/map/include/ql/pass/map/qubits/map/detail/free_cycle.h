/**
 * FreeCycle: map each real qubit to the first cycle that it is free for use.
 *
 * In scheduling gates, qubit dependencies cause latencies. For each real qubit,
 * the first cycle that it is free to use is the cycle that the last gate that
 * was scheduled in the qubit, has just finished (i.e. in the previous cycle);
 * the map serves as a summary to ease scheduling next gates.
 *
 * Likewise, while mapping, swaps are scheduled just before a non-NN two-qubit
 * gate. Moreover, such swaps may involve real qubits on the path between the
 * real operand qubits of the gate, which may be different from the real operand
 * qubits. The evaluation of which path of swaps is best is, among other data,
 * based on which path causes the latency of the whole circuit to be extended
 * the least. This latency extension is measured from the data in the FreeCycle
 * map; so a FreeCycle map is part of each path of swaps that is evaluated for a
 * particular non-NN 2-qubit gate next to a FreeCycle map that is part of the
 * output stream (the main past).
 *
 * Since gate durations are in nanoseconds, and one cycle is some fixed number
 * of nanoseconds, the duration is converted to a rounded-up number of cycles
 * when computing the added latency.
