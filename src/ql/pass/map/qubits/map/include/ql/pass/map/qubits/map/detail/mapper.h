// Note on the use of constructors and Init functions for classes of the mapper
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Almost all classes of the mapper have one or more members that require
// initialization using a value that was passed on to the Mapper.initialize
// function as a parameter (i.e. platform, cycle_time). Dealing with those
// initializations in the nested constructors was cumbersome. Hence, the
// constructors create just skeleton objects which need explicit initialization
// before use. Such initialization is provided by a class local initialize
// function for a virgin object, or by copying an existing object to it.
// The constructors are trivial by this and can be synthesized by default.
//
// Construction of skeleton objects requires the used classes to provide such
// (non-parameterized) constructors.

/**
 * Mapper: map operands of gates and insert swaps so that two-qubit gate
 * operands are nearest-neighbor (NN).
 *
 * All gates must be unary or two-qubit gates. The operands are virtual qubit
 * indices. After mapping, all virtual qubit operands have been mapped to real
 * qubit operands.
 *
 * For the mapper to work, the number of virtual qubits (nvq) must be less equal
 * to the number of real qubits (nrq): nvq <= nrq; the mapper assumes that the
 * virtual qubit operands (vqi) are encoded as a number 0 <= vqi < nvq, and that
 * the real qubit operands (rqi) are encoded as a number 0 <= rqi < nrq. The nrq
 * is given by the platform, nvq is given by the kernel. The mapper ignores the
 * latter (0 <= vqi < nvq was tested when creating the gates), and assumes vqi,
 * nvq, rqi and nrq to be of the same type (utils::UInt) 0<=qi<nrq. Because of
 * this, it makes no difference between nvq and nrq, and refers to both as nq,
 * and initializes the latter from the platform. All maps mapping virtual and
 * real qubits to something are of size nq.
 *
 * Mapping maps each used virtual qubit to a real qubit index, but which one
 * that is, may change. For a 2-qubit gate its operands should be
 * nearest-neighbor; when its virtual operand qubits are not mapping to nearest
 * neighbors, that should be accomplished by moving/swapping the virtual qubits
 * from their current real qubits to real qubits that are nearest neighbors:
 * those moves/swaps are inserted just before that 2-qubit gate. Anyhow, the
 * virtual operand qubits of gates must be mapped to the real ones, holding
 * their state.
 *
 * While mapping, the relationship between virtual and real qubits is tracked by
 * a QubitMapping object. This tracks two things.
 *
 *  - The actual virtual to real qubit map. It's possible for virtual qubits to
 *    not be mapped to a real qubit yet, and it's possible for real qubits to
 *    be unused. Virtual qubits are in use as soon as they have been encountered
 *    as operands in the program, at which point they are allocated, unless the
 *    map is initialized one to one before mapping, or initial placement has
 *    already determined a mapping. When a virtual qubit is not in use, it maps
 *    to UNDEFINED_QUBIT. The reverse operation also exists (get_virtual());
 *    when there is no virtual qubit that maps to a particular real qubit, it
 *    also returns UNDEFINED_QUBIT. At any time, the virtual to real and reverse
 *    maps are 1-1 for qubits that are in use.
 *
 *  - The liveness/state of each real qubit. This can be none (the state is
 *    garbage), initialized (the state is |0>), or live (the state is anything
 *    in use by the kernel). The states start out as none or initialized,
 *    depending on whether the mapper is configured such that it's allowed to
 *    assume that the qubits have already been initialized before the start of
 *    the kernel. Any quantum gate presented to the mapper by the input circuit
 *    puts the state of its qubits into the live state, except prepz if the
 *    mapper is configured such that it treats it as an initialization. The
 *    initialized state is used to replace swap gates (3 CNOTs) with moves
 *    (2 CNOTs): if either qubit being routed through is initialized rather than
 *    live, a move is inserted (if moves are enabled at all via configuration)
 *    rather than a swap, and if either qubit being routed through is in the
 *    garbage state, the mapper will see if initializing it does not increase
 *    circuit length too much (the threshold is configurable).
 *
 * Classical registers are ignored by the mapper currently. TO BE DONE.
 *
 * The mapping is done in the context of a grid of qubits defined by the given
 * platform. The information about this grid lives in platform.topology.
 *
 * For each kernel there are two methods: initial placement and a heuristic,
 * of which initial placement may do a half-hearted job, while heuristic will
 * always be successful in finding a map; but what initial placement may find,
 * it will be used by the heuristic as an initial mapping; they are in this
 * order.
 *
 * Each kernel in the program is independently mapped (see the map_kernel
 * method), ignoring inter-kernel control flow and thereby the requirement to
 * pass on the current mapping.
 *
 * Anticipating inter-kernel mapping, the mapper maintains a kernel input
 * mapping coming from the context, and produces a kernel output mapping for the
 * context; the mapper updates the kernel's circuit from virtual to real.
 *
 * Without inter-kernel control flow, the flow is as follows.
 *  - Mapping starts from a 1 to 1 mapping of virtual to real qubits (the kernel
 *    input mapping), in which all virtual qubits are initialized to a fixed
 *    constant state (|0>/inited), suitable for replacing swap by move.
 *  - Optionally attempt an initial placement of the circuit, starting from the
 *    kernel input mapping and thus optionally updating the virtual to real map
 *    and the state of used virtuals (from initialized to live).
 *  - Use heuristics to map the input (or what initial placement left to do),
 *    mapping the virtual gates to (sets of) real gates, and outputing the new
 *    map and the new virtuals' state
 *  - Optionally decompose swap and/or cnot gates in the real circuit to
 *    primitives (make_primitive).
 *
 * Inter-kernel control flow and consequent mapping dependence between kernels
 * is not implemented. TO BE DONE. The design of mapping multiple kernels is as
 * follows (TO BE ADAPTED TO NEW REALSTATE).
 *
 *  - Initially the program wide initial mapping is a 1 to 1 mapping of virtual
 *    to real qubits.
 *  - When starting to map a kernel, there is a set of already mapped kernels,
 *    and a set of not yet mapped kernels. Of each mapped kernel, there is an
 *    output mapping, i.e. the mapping of virts to reals with the rs per
 *    virtual. The current kernel has a set of kernels which are direct
 *    predecessor in the program's control flow, a subset of those direct
 *    predecessors thus has been mapped and another subset not mapped; the
 *    output mappings of the mapped predecessor kernels are input.
 *  - Unify these multiple input mappings to a single one; this may introduce
 *    swaps on the control flow edges. The result is the input mapping of the
 *    current kernel; keep it for later reference.
 *  - Attempt an initial placement of the circuit, starting from the kernel
 *    input mapping.
 *  - Use heuristics to map the input (or what initial placement left to do).
 *  - When done, keep the output mapping as the kernel's output mapping. For all
 *    mapped successor kernels, compute a transition from output to their input,
 *    and add it to the edge; the edge code must be optimized for:
 *     - being empty: nothing needs to be done
 *     - having a source with one succ; the edge code can be appended to that
 *       succ
 *     - having a target with one pred; the edge code can be prepended to that
 *       pred
 *     - otherwise, a separate intermediate kernel for the transition code must
 *       be created, and added.
 *
 * THE ABOVE INTER-KERNEL MAPPING IS NOT IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * The Mapper's main entry is map_kernel which manages the input and output
 * streams of QASM instructions, and does the logic between (global) initial
 * placement mapper and the (more local) heuristic mapper. It selects the
 * quantum gates from it, and maps these in the context of what was mapped
 * before (the Past). Each gate is separately mapped in MapGate in the main
 * Past's context.
