/**
 * Future: input window for mapper.
 *
 * The future window shows the gates that still must be mapped as the
 * availability list of a list scheduler that would work on a dependency graph
 * representation of each input circuit. This future window is initialized once
 * for the whole program, and gets a method call when it should switch to a new
 * circuit (corresponding to a new kernel). In each circuit and thus each
 * dependency graph the gates (including classical instruction) are found; the
 * dependency graph models their dependencies and also whether they act as
 * barriers, an example of the latter being a classical branch. The availability
 * list with gates (including classical instructions) is the main interface to
 * the mapper, i.e. the mapper selects one or more element(s) from it to map
 * next; it may even create alternatives for each combination of available
 * gates. The gates in the list have attributes like criticality, which can be
 * exploited by the mapper. The dependency graph and the availability list
 * operations are provided by the Scheduler class.
 *
 * The future is a window because in principle it could be implemented
 * incrementally, i.e. that the dependence graph would be extended when an
 * attribute gets below a threshold, e.g. when successors of a gate are
 * interrogated for a particular attribute. A problem might be that criticality
 * requires having seen the end of the circuit, but the space overhead of this
 * attribute is much less than that of a full dependence graph. The
 * implementation below is not incremental: it creates the dep graph for a
 * circuit completely.
 *
 * The implementation below just selects the most critical gate from the
 * availability list as next candidate to map, the idea being that any
 * collateral damage of mapping this gate will have a lower probability of
 * increasing circuit depth than taking a non-critical gate as first one to map.
 * Later implementations may become more sophisticated.
 *
 * With the lookahead_mode option disabled, the future window's dependency
 * graphs (scheduled and avlist) are not used. Instead, a copy of the input
 * circuit (input_gatepv) is created and iterated over (input_gatepp).
