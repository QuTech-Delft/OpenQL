    The purpose of this pass is to ensure that the qubit connectivity
    constraints are met for all multi-qubit gates in each kernel. This is done
    by optionally applying a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to look
    for a perfect solution that does not require routing or figure out a good
    initial qubit placement, and then by heuristically inserting swap/move gates
    to change the mapping on the fly as needed. Finally, it decomposes all gates
    in the circuit to primitive gates.

    NOTE: the substeps of this pass will probably be subdivided into individual
    passes in the future.

    WARNING: this pass currently operates purely on a per-kernel basis. Because
    it may adjust the qubit mapping from input to output, a program consisting
    of multiple kernels that maintains a quantum state between the kernels may
    be silently destroyed.

    * Initial placement *

      This step attempts to find a single mapping of the virtual qubits of a
      circuit to the real qubits of the platform's qubit topology that minimizes
      the sum of the distances between the two mapped operands of all
      two-qubit gates in the circuit. The distance between two real qubits is
      the minimum number of swaps that is required to move the state of one of
      the two qubits to the other. It employs a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
      (MIP) algorithm to solve this, modelled as a Quadratic Assignment Problem.
      If enabled, this step may find a mapping that is optimal for the whole
      circuit, but because its time-complexity is exponential with respect to
      the size of the circuit, this may take quite some computer time. Also, the
      result is only really useful when in the mapping found all mapped operands
      of two-qubit gates are nearest-neighbor (i.e. distance 1). So, there is no
      guarantee for success: it may take too long and the result may not be
      optimal.

      NOTE: availability of this step depends on the build configuration of
      OpenQL due to license conflicts with the library used for solving the
      MIP problem. If it is not included, the step is effectively no-op, and
      a warning message will be printed.
)" R"(
    * Heuristic routing *

      This step essentially transforms the program by iterating over its gates
      from front to back and inserting `swap` or `move` gates when needed.
      Whenever it does this, it updates its internal virtual to real qubit
      mapping. While iterating, the virtual qubit indices of the incoming gates
      are replaced with real qubit indices, i.e. those defined in the topology
      section of the platform.

      Some platforms have gates for which parameters differ based on the qubits
      they operate on. For example, `cz q0, q1` may have a different duration
      than `cz q2, q3`, and `cz q0, q2` may not even exist because of
      topological constraints. However, rules like this make no sense when the
      cz gate is still using virtual qubit indices: it's perfectly fine for the
      user to do `cz q0, q2` at the input if the mapper is enabled.

      To account for this, the mapper will look for an alternative gate
      definition when it converts the virtual qubit indices to real qubit
      indices: specifically, it will look for a gate with `_real` or `_prim`
      (see also the primitive decomposition step) appended to the original gate
      name. For example, `cz q0, q2` may, after routing, be transformed to
      `cz_real q2, q3`. This allows you to define `cz` using a generalized gate
      definition (i.e. independent on qubit operands), and `cz_real` as a set of
      specialized gates as required by the platform.

      NOTE: the resolution order is `*_prim`, `*_real`, and finally just the
      original gate name. Thus, if you don't need this functionality, you don't
      need to define any `*_real` gates.

      Because the mapper inserts swap and/or move gates, it is important that
      these gates are actually defined in the configuration file (usually by
      means of a decomposition rule). The semantics for them must be as follows.

       - `swap x, y` or `swap_real x, y`: must apply a complete swap gate to the
         given qubits to exchange their state. If in the final decomposition one
         of the operands is used before the other, the second operand (`y`) is
         expected to be used first for the `reverse_swap_if_better` option to
         work right.

       - `move x, y` or `move_real x, y`: if `use_moves` is enabled, the mapper
         will attempt to use these gates instead of `swap`/`swap_real` if it
         knows that the `y` qubit is in the `|0>` state (or it can initialize
         it as such) and the result is better (or not sufficiently worse) than
         using a normal swap. Such a move gate can be implemented with two CNOTs
         instead of three.

      The order in which non-nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates are routed, the
      route taken for them, and where along the route the actual two-qubit gate
      is performed, is determined heuristically. The way in which this is done
      is controlled by the various options for this pass; it can be made really
      simple by just iterating over the circuit in the specified order and just
      choosing a random routing alternative whenever routing is needed, or more
      intelligent methods can be used at the cost of execution time and memory
      usage (the latter especially when a lot of alternative solutions are
      generated before a choice is made). Based on these options, time and space
      complexity can be anywhere from linear to exponential!
)" R"(
    * Decomposition into primitives *

      As a final step, the mapper will try to decompose the "real" gates (i.e.
      gates with qubit operands referring to real qubits) generated by the
      previous step into primitive gates, as actually executable by the
      target architecture. It does this by attempting to suffix the name of
      each gate with `_prim`. Thus, if you define a decomposition rule named
      `cz_prim` rather than `cz`, this rule will only be applied after mapping.
