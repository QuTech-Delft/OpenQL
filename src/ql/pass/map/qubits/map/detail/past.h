/**
 * Past: state of the mapper while somewhere in the mapping process.
 *
 * There is a Past attached to the output stream, that is a kind of window with
 * a list of gates in it, to which gates are added after mapping. This is called
 * the 'main' Past. While mapping, several alternatives are evaluated, each of
 * which also has a Past attached, and each of which for most of the parts
 * start off as a copy of the 'main' Past. But it is in fact a temporary
 * extension of this main Past.
 *
 * Past contains gates of which the schedule might influence a future path
 * selected for mapping binary gates. It maintains for each qubit from which
 * cycle on it is free, so that swap insertion can exploit this to hide its
 * overall circuit latency overhead by increasing ILP. Also it maintains the 1
 * to 1 (reversible) virtual to real qubit map: all gates in past and beyond are
 * mapped and have real qubits as operands. While experimenting with path
 * alternatives, a clone is made of the main past, to insert swaps and evaluate
 * the latency effects; note that inserting swaps changes the mapping.
 *
 * On arrival of a quantum gate(s):
 *  - [isempty(waiting_gates)]
 *  - if 2q nonNN clone mult. pasts, in each clone add swap/move gates,
 *    schedule, evaluate clones, select, add swaps to mainPast
 *  - add(), add(), ...: add quantum gates to waiting_gates, waiting to be
 *    scheduled in [!isempty(waiting_gates)]
 *  - schedule(): schedules all quantum gates of waiting_gates into gates
 *    [isempty(waiting_gates) && !isempty(gates)]
 *
 * On arrival of a classical gate:
 *  - flush_all: gates flushed to output_gates
 *    [isempty(waiting_gates) && isempty(gates) && !isempty(output_gates)]
 *  - bypass: classical gate added to output_gates
 *    [isempty(waiting_gates) && isempty(gates) && !isempty(output_gates)]
 *
 * On no gates:
 *  - [isempty(waiting_gates)]
 *  - flush_all: lg flushed to output_gates
 *    [isempty(waiting_gates) && isempty(gates) && !isempty(output_gates)]
 *
 * On end:
 *  - flush_to_circuit: output_gates flushed to output circuit
 *    [isempty(waiting_gates) && isempty(gates) && isempty(output_gates)]

     * with "_real" appended, with the real qubits as operands, then create that
     * gate, otherwise keep the old gate, replacing the virtual qubit operands
     * by the real qubit indices. Since creating a new gate may result in a
     * decomposition to several gates, the result is returned as a circuit
     * vector.
     *
     * So each gate in the circuit (optionally) passes through the following
     * phases.
     *
     *   1. It is created. When it maps to a decomposition in the config file,
     *      it is decomposed immediately, otherwise the gate is created normally
     *      (k.gate). So we expect gates like x, cz, cnot to be specified in the
     *      config file; on the resulting (decomposed) gates, the routing is
     *      done, including depth/cost estimation.
     *
     *  2a. If needed for mapping, a swap/move is created. First try creating
     *      swap_real/move_real as above, otherwise just swap/real (AddSwap).
     *      So we expect gates like swap_real and move_real to be specified in
     *      the config file. swap_real/move_real, unlike swap/real, allow
     *      immediate decomposition; when no swap_real/move_real are specified,
     *      just swap/move must be present and swap/move are created, usually
     *      without decomposition. The routing is done on the resulting
     *      (decomposed) gates, including depth/cost estimation; when the
     *      resulting gates end in _prim, see step 3.
     *
     *  2b. The resulting gates of step 1 have their operands/gate mapped. First
     *      try creating gate_real as above, otherwise just gate (make_real()).
     *      gate_real, unlike gate, allows immediate decomposition; when the
     *      resulting gates end in _prim, see step 3.
     *
     *   3. Make primitive gates. For each gate try recreating it with _prim
     *      appended to its name, otherwise keep it; this decomposes those with
     *      corresponding _prim entries.
     *
     *   4. Final schedule: the resulting gates are subject to final scheduling
