 *  right now because:
 *   - place() does not actually modify the kernel, it just outputs a map.
 *     There is no place for that in the IR (at least not right now), so
 *     at best it could add an annotation, which would be weird. It should
 *     just update the gates immediately, but this is also problematic right
 *     now, because merely making a gate triggers decompositions.
 *   - decompose_to_primitives() could be split off relatively easily, but
 *     there's no point in doing that now, because we want a generic
 *     decomposition pass anyway, and it needs the same kludges for adding gates
 *     as the mapper does, so it (ab)uses those and is thus linked to the mapper
 *     code.
