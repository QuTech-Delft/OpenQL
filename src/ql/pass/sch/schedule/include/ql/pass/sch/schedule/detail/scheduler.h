// =========== plain schedulers, just ASAP and ALAP, without RC

/*
    Summary

    The schedulers are linear list schedulers, i.e.
    - they scan linearly through the code, forward or backward
    - and while doing, they maintain a list of gates, of gates that are available for being scheduled
      because they are not blocked by dependences on non-scheduled gates.
    Therefore, the schedulers are able to select the best one from multiple available gates.
    Not all gates that are available (not blocked by dependences on non-scheduled gates) can actually be scheduled.
    It must be made sure in addition that:
    - those scheduled gates that it depends on, actually have completed their execution
    - the resources are available for it
    Furthermore, making a selection from the nodes that remain determines the optimality of the scheduling result.
    The schedulers below are critical path schedulers, i.e. they prefer to schedule the most critical node first.
    The criticality of a node is measured by estimating
    the effect of delaying scheduling it on the depth of the resulting circuit.

    The schedulers don't actually scan the circuit themselves but rely on a dependence graph representation of the circuit.
    At the start, depending on the scheduling direction, only the top (or bottom) node is available.
    Then one by one, according to an optimality criterion, a node is selected from the list of available ones
    and added to the schedule. Having scheduled the node, it is taken out of the available list;
    also having scheduled a node, some new nodes may become available because they don't depend on non-scheduled nodes anymore;
    those nodes are found and put in the available list of nodes.
    This continues, filling cycle by cycle from low to high (or from high to low when scheduling backward),
    until the available list gets empty (which happens after scheduling the last node, the bottom (or top when backward).

// =========== schedulers with RC
    // Most code from here on deals with scheduling with Resource Constraints.
    // Then the cycles as computed from the depgraph alone start to drift because of resource conflicts,
    // and then it is more optimal to at each point consider all available nodes for scheduling
    // to avoid largely suboptimal results (issue 179), i.e. apply list scheduling.

    // In critical-path scheduling, usually more-critical instructions are preferred;
    // an instruction is more-critical when its ASAP and ALAP values differ less.
    // When scheduling with resource constraints, the ideal ASAP/ALAP cycle values cannot
    // be attained because of resource conflicts being in the way, they will 'slip',
    // so actual cycle values cannot be compared anymore to ideal ASAP/ALAP values to compute criticality;
    // but when forward (backward) scheduling, a lower ALAP (higher ASAP) indicates more criticality
    // (i.e. in ASAP scheduling use the ALAP values to know the criticality, and vice-versa);
    // those ALAP/ASAP are then a measure for number of cycles still to fill with gates in the schedule,
    // and are coined 'remaining' cycles here.
    //
    // remaining[node] indicates number of cycles remaining in schedule after start execution of node;
    //
    // Please note that for forward (backward) scheduling we use an
    // adaptation of the ALAP (ASAP) cycle computation to compute the remaining values; with this
    // definition both in forward and backward scheduling, a higher remaining indicates more criticality.
    // This means that criticality has become independent of the direction of scheduling
    // which is easier in the core of the scheduler.
