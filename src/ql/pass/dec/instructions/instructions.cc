    This pass (conditionally) applies instructions decomposition rules as
    specified in the platform configuration JSON structure. The pass returns the
    number of rules that were applied.

    Rules can be disabled for the purpose of this pass using the `predicate_key`
    and `predicate_value` options. When set, the key given by `predicate_key` is
    resolved in the JSON data that may be associated with new-style
    decomposition rules (the ones associated with instructions, rather than
    the ones specified in the `"gate_decomposition"` section of the platform
    JSON file). If this resolves to a string, the `predicate_value` option is
    matched against it. The rule is then only applied if there is a match. Some
    special cases:

     - if the key does not exist in the JSON data associated with the
       decomposition rule, or if it exists but maps to something that isn't a
       string, the predicate will match if `predicate_value` matches an empty
       string; and
     - the effective JSON structure for legacy decomposition rules is
       `{"name": "legacy"}`.

    The `ignore_schedule` option controls how scheduling information is treated.
    When set to yes (the default), the cycle numbers of the decomposed
    instructions will be set to the same cycle number as the original
    instruction. When set to no, the schedule of the decomposed instructions is
    taken from the decomposition rule, and instructions are reordered
    accordingly after all decompositions have taken place.
)" R"(
    For example, assume that we have the following decomposition rule for a
    CNOT gate:

        ym90 op(1)
        cz op(0), op(1)
        skip 1
        y90 op(1)

    and that we have the following program as input:

        {
            cnot q[0], q[1]
            cnot q[1], q[2]
        }

    Now, if `ignore_schedule` is enabled, the resulting program would be

        {
            ym90 q[1]
            cz q[0], q[1]
            y90 q[1]
            ym90 q[2]
            cz q[1], q[2]
            y90 q[2]
        }

    The schedule is obviously invalid, because qubits are being used by multiple
    gates in the same cycle. But so was the input. Nevertheless, the order of
    the instructions is what we wanted; after scheduling, the program will be
    correct.

    If we were to turn `ignore_schedule` off, however, this is what we'd get:

        {
            ym90 q[1]
            ym90 q[2]
        }
        {
            cz q[0], q[1]
            cz q[1], q[2]
        }
        skip 1
        {
            y90 q[1]
            y90 q[2]
        }
)" R"(
    Which is wrong! The `ym90` and `y90` gates execute out of order with the
    `cz q[1], q[2]` now. Scheduling won't fix this.

    The key takeaway here is that you should leave `ignore_schedule` enabled if
    A) the program has not been scheduled yet or B) you're not sure that the
    schedules in the decomposition rules are actually defined correctly.

    Of course, there are cases where `ignore_schedule` needs to be disabled,
    otherwise the option wouldn't need to be there. It's useful specifically
    when you need to process code expansions *after* scheduling. You will need
    to make sure that the decomposition rules that the predicate matches are
    written such that they won't ever break a correctly scheduled program, but
    if that's the case, you won't have to schedule the program again after the
    decomposition. For example, if the input program had been

        cnot q[0], q[1]
        skip 3
        cnot q[1], q[2]

    the result with `ignore_schedule` disabled would have been

        ym90 q[1]
        cz q[0], q[1]
        skip 1
        y90 q[1]
        ym90 q[2]
        cz q[1], q[2]
        skip 1
        y90 q[2]

    which is not an optimal schedule by any means, but a correct one
    nonetheless. A more reasonable use case for this than CNOT to CZ
    decomposition would be expanding a CZ gate to single-qubit flux and parking
    gates; it's vital that these gates will not be shifted around with respect
    to each other, which scheduling after decomposing them might do.
