/** \file
 * Defines basic criticality heuristics for the list scheduler.
 *
 * Heuristic classes must consist of two operator() overloads:
 *
 *  - `Bool operator()(const StatementRef &lhs, const StatementRef &rhs) const`
 *    and
 *  - `Str operator()(const StatementRef &val) const`
 *
 * The former implements a standard less-than comparator for the criticality of
 * the two given statements. This is what's used to actually order the list of
 * available instructions.
 *
 * The latter is just used for debugging. It should return a string
 * representation of the criticality of the given statement.
