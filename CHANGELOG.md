## [ 0.11.0 ] - [ 2023-01-06 ]
### Added
- CC backend:
  - support for cQASM 1.2 features through new IR 
    - limitations
      - integer values must be non-negative
  - support for resource constrained scheduler
  - creates .map file reporting measurement statements present in input, to allow retrieving measurements downstream
- support for Python up to 3.11

### Changed
- pass dec.Instructions: duration=0 in new-style decomposition rules now disables checking whether expansion fits, allowing automatic calculation of duration (and requiring scheduling after decomposition of such rules)
- CC backend:
  - now uses new IR
  - no longer requires key "cc" to be present in instructions that define gate decompositions
  - key "readout_mode" no longer used
    - classification of gates as measurement - which is used for the resource constrained scheduler, and to output a map of measurements - now based on signal definition ("signal/type" equals "measure" and "signal/value" non-empty)
    - classification of gates as *real-time* measurement now based on signal definition ("signal/type" equals "measure" and "signal/value" empty)
  - absence of key "cc" now implies empty "signal", so `"cc": { "signal": [] }` is no longer necessary
- passes and architectures self-register statically to their respective factories
- initial placer uses new IR and new MIP solver called HiGHS

### Removed
- CC backend:
  - support for JSON key "pragma/break" for instruction definitions
  - macro expansion for JSON key instruction/signal/value (unused anyway)
- support for sweep points in API and the WriteSweepPointsPass
- support for Python up to and including 3.6

### Fixed
- pass dec.Instructions
  - corrected ordering of instruction decomposition (which reversed multi-statement decompositions)
  - decomposed instructions were silently made unconditional, we  now copy instruction condition to decomposed instructions


## [ 0.10.0 ] - [ 2021-07-15 ]
### Added
- scalability options for coping with large multi-core systems, including a progress bar for the mapping process
- initial implementation of the Diamond architecture developed for Fujitsu (lead by Stephan Wong)
- full cQASM 1.2 read and write support, with options for different version levels and various language quirks
- new internal representation that encompasses the entire cQASM 1.2 language, and has many new generalized platform features
- lossless conversion functions between the two IR representations until all passes have been converted to the new representation
- new pass-based decomposition logic that supports arbitrary cQASM 1.2 code for the expansion and doesn't clobber scheduling information
- new pass for converting structured cQASM 1.2 control flow to basic block form
- new list scheduler based on the new IR

### Changed
- all written cQASM files are now in 1.2 format by default
- the cQASM reader no longer has a JSON configuration file for mapping cQASM gates to OpenQL gates; this translation is now part of OpenQL's platform data
- the old scheduler is replaced with a new implementation for most option variations, that outputs slightly different schedules
- statistics report output is also formatted slightly different, though information content is the same
- CC backend:
    - scheduling is now done using resource constraints by default

### Fixed
- excessive memory usage and slow platform construction for large multi-core systems


## [ 0.9.0 ] - [ 2021-05-27 ]
### Added
- architecture system: platform and compilation strategy defaults are now built into OpenQL, preventing the need for users to copypaste configuration files from the tests directory
- interface (C++ and Python) to compile cQASM 1.x
- allow 'wait' and 'barrier' in JSON section 'gate_decomposition'
- CC backend:
    - improved reporting on JSON semantic errors
    - added check for dimension of "instruments/qubits" against "instruments/ref_control_mode/control_bits"
    - added check for dimension of "instructions/<key>/cc/[signals,ref_signal]/value" against "instruments/ref_control_mode/control_bits"
    - added cross check of "instruments/ref_control_mode" against "instrument_definitions"
    - added support for "pragma/break" in JSON definition to define 'gate' that breaks out of loop
    - added support to distribute measurement results via DSM
    - added support for conditional gates
    - added compile option "--backend_cc_run_once"
    - added compile option "--backend_cc_verbose"

### Changed
- pass management: instead of a hardcoded compilation strategy, the strategy can be adjusted and fine-tuned manually
- pass options: instead of doing everything with global options, global options were replaced with pass options as much as possible
- most documentation is now generated from code and can be queried using API calls
- scheduler resources are completely reworked to be made more generic
- major internal refactoring and restructuring to facilitate the above two things
- CC backend:
    - renamed JSON field "signal_ref" to "ref_signal"
    - renamed JSON field "ref_signals_type" to "signal_type"
    - changed JSON field "static_codeword_override" to be a vector with one element per qubit parameter. To edit a JSON file using Sublime, use Replace with Regular Expressions: find=`"static_codeword_override": ([0-9])+`, replace=`"static_codeword_override": [\1]`
    - adopted new module synchronization scheme ("seq_bar semantics", requires CC software >= v0.2.0, PycQED after commit 470df5b)
    - JSON field "instruction/type" no longer used by backend, use "instruction/cc/readout_mode" to flag measurement instructions
    - allow specification of 2 triggers in JSON field "control_modes/*/trigger_bits" to support dual-QWG
    - changed label in generated code from "mainLoop" to "__mainLoop". Do not start kernel names with "__" (this should be specified by the API)
    - removed initial 1 cycle (20 ns) delay at start of kernels (resulting from bundle start_cycle starting at 1)
    - correctly handle kernel names containing "_" in conjunction with looping (formerly duplicate labels could arise)
    - added "seq_out 0,1" to program start to allow tracing of actual program start

### Removed
- CC-light code generation, as the CC-light is being phased out in the lab, and its many passes were obstacles for pass management and refactoring
- rotation optimization based on matrices; matrices in general were removed entirely because no one was using it
- the commute variation pass, as it has been superseded by in-place commutations within the scheduler
- the toffoli decomposition pass, as it wasn't really used; to decompose a toffoli gate, use generic platform-driven decomposition instead
- the defunct fidelity estimation logic from metrics.cc; this may be added again later, but requires lots of cleanup and isn't currently in use
- quantumsim and qsoverlay output; apparently this was no longer being used, and it was quite intertwined with the CC-light backend


### Fixed
- changed register used for FOR loop, so it doesn't clash with delay setting
- fixed documentation for python setup and running tests
- various miscellaneous bugs, dangling pointers, and memory leaks
