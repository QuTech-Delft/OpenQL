# This file contains the definitions of opcodes of the classic and quantum
# instructions.
# It is used in the build phase of QISA-AS, to define the opcodes for the
# predefined classic instructions, and to define new quantum instructions.
#
# The opcodes for the instructions are defined in four dictionaries, which
# are described in the following comments.

# def_opcode
#
# Define opcode for a single-format instruction.
# The instruction name must be one of the predefined classic instructions.
# The valid range of the opcode is: 0-63. The opcode corresponds to bits
#   [30:25] in the single-format instruction, excluding(!) the bit 31.
# It must be unique with respect to the other defined classic instructions.
#
# Specify as:
#
#   def_opcode['<instruction_name>'] = <opcode>
#
#
# Example:
#
#   def_opcode['BEQ'] = 0x21

# def_q_arg_none
#
# Define opcode for a double-format instruction that has no arguments.
# The instruction is added to the list of known quantum instructions.
# The valid range of the opcode is: 0-255. It corresponds to the bits [13:6]
#  of a double instruction.
# It must be unique with respect to the other defined quantum instructions.
#
# Specify as:
#
#   def_q_arg_none['<instruction_name>'] = <opcode>
#
# Example:
#
#   def_q_arg_none['QNOP'] = 0x0
#
# NOTE: there is only one such instruction in the current CC-Light:
#       QNOP with the opcode of 0.


# def_q_arg_st
#
# Define opcode for a quantum instruction that uses one of the available 'S'
# registers.
# The instruction is added to the list of known quantum instructions.
# The valid range of the opcode is: 1-127. It corresponds to the bits [13:6]
#  of a double instruction.
# It must be unique with respect to the other defined quantum instructions.
#
# Specify as:
#
#   def_q_arg_st['<instruction_name>'] = <opcode>
#
# Example:
#
#   def_q_arg_st['H'] = 0x12

# def_q_arg_tt
#
# Define opcode for a quantum instruction that uses one of the available 'T'
# registers.
# The instruction is added to the list of known quantum instructions.
# The valid range of the opcode is: 128-255. It corresponds to the bits [13:6]
#  of a double instruction.
# It must be unique with respect to the other defined quantum instructions.
#
# Specify as:
#
#   def_q_arg_tt['<instruction_name>'] = <opcode>
#
# Example:
#
#   def_q_arg_tt['SWAP'] = 0x83

# Note on the extension of this file:
# Originally, it was named qisa_instructions.def, but the .def instruction
# has a special meaning on the Windows platform.
# It is now called qisa_instructions.dbpd
# This hopefully unique extension stands for
#   'Definition By Python Dictionaries'.
